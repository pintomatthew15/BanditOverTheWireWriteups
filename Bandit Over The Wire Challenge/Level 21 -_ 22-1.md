Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

Commands Used
Navigating to ```/etc/cron.d``` we find that the the bandit22 cron job references a script located in ```/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh```


```
$ cd /etc/crond.
$ cat cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

We then navigate to ```/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh```

```
$ cd /usr/bin/
$ cat cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

It looks like the password is being stored in the /tmp directory
```
$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
